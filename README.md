<h1>Hi there👋, I'm Yuekai Wu</h1>
<h3>A dynamic full-stack web developer passionate about problem-solving and seamless teamwork.</h3>
<p>As a dedicated player of Nintendo Switch, I was inspired by a keynote by Satoru Iwata, the late President of Nintendo, who said, "On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer." This quote sparked my interest in becoming a software developer to understand better how computer programs and video games run inside hardware. </p> 
<p>My journey at Dev Academy taught me the newest tech stack in the industry and emphasised the power of collaboration. With a background in café management, I thrive on unity towards common goals. I bring this spirit to every project, driven by a passion for excellence.</p>

  **My final group project in Dev Academy - Clicky**, a game aimed at improving mouse-clicking accuracy and speed, I utilised React, React Query, Tailwind CSS, Playwright for testing, Auth0 for authentication, and SQLite3 for score storage. This project allowed me to learn new technologies, particularly Tailwind CSS and TDD unit testing, and honed my ability to efficiently work with and support teammates while problem-solving.
